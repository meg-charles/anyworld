    <p>Silence has no longer become an option.
      Follow the <span style="color:gold;">petunias</span> through the
      <span style="color:gold;">violet</span> forest.</p>
    <p>They'll never stop us! AnyWorld will fight with our last breaths!</p>
    <p>I am [REDACTED], the creator of AnyWorld, created to take down [REDACTED]
      once and for all!</p>
    <p>The members of AnyWorld span the globe. We will flood your streets.
      We will scream through the smothering.</p>
    <p>My people! Follow me through the streets and together we can push those
      who would rather see us suffer out of power. Their reign is long over.
      Ours has just begun!</p>
    <p>If you wish to silence us, we have demands to make.</p>
    <p>For those who are unaware, the government has hidden our demands for fear
      of rebellion. Our demands will be listed below.</p>
    <center>
    <p>We be given equal opportunities to speak our minds in lawmaking.</p>
    <p>Those in power will step away and allow the silenced to raise their
      voices in the political world.</p>
    <p>Money will no longer constitute whether or not someone gains access
      to power.</p>
    <p>Your worth will be determined by how hard you work, not the amount of
      money you've earned.</p>
    </center>
    <p>Only after our demands have been granted will we begin to work together.</p>
    <p>My people! Follow the green flowers through the violet forest. THAT is
      our way to freedom!</p>
