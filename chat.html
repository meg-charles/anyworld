      <p>trapdoor says: anyone have any info on [REDACTED] or are they gone forever?</p>
      <p>gratis says: Try not using irl names pls. But I think they were taken out
        to sea bc I haven't heard from them in like 3 weeks.</p>
      <p>trapdoor says: yeah that's what i was kinda afraid of :/</p>
      <p>trapdoor says: wish we could've arranged a fireworks show before this happened.</p>
      <p>gratis says: All the more reason to follow along with AnyWorld. They know
        what they're doing.</p>

      <p>vega says: just had a herd of pigs follow behind my car as i was driving home.
        most terrified ive been in years. why cant they mind their own goddamn business?</p>
      <p>spirals says: My God. Did you take pics or video?</p>
      <p>vega says: i did but whats the point? its not like i could turn it in and
        something would happen with the pigs in question. didnt get a license plate
        or badge number so its useless.</p>
      <p>spirals says: you feeling alright? you somewhere safe?</p>
      <p>vega says: no. i sped ahead and managed to scoot onto a dirt road. my cars
        black so im pretty well hidden but im sure if they went to so much effort that
        theyll still be looking for me</p>
      <p>Admin says: Vega, if you would like to get in contact with AnyWorld support
        so you feel safer, send a private message to the Admin account and you will
        be transferred to a support member in your area to escort you home.</p>
